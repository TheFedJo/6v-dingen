Matthew 5: 38-42
38 Ye have heard that it hath been said, An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth:
39 But I say unto you, That ye resist not evil: but whosoever shall smite thee on thy right cheek, turn to him the other also.
40 And if any man will sue thee at the law, and take away thy coat, let him have thy cloak also.
41 And whosoever shall compel thee to go a mile, go with him twain.
42 Give to him that asketh thee, and from him that would borrow of thee turn not thou away.

Summary:
Many people have gone wrong on this particular piece of text. Some become immersed into the details, others claim this and the Sermon on the mount in general does not contain doctrine, only practical advice. This is far from the truth. It is not important to be able to turn the cheek, but your general attitude of self should be different. Man by nature is ready to defend himself, however this is not Christian. We should become indifferent to our own interests. George Muller once said he died to the world, his friends and then himself. This sequence is very important. Obviously, it is easy to ignore the world, however ignoring your friends and yourself becomes increasingly difficult. A gentleman, according to the world, is not afraid to defend himself and his interests. This aggressive type of person is not Christian. A Christian has died to himself and Christ lives in him. Every instance of unhappiness is caused by separation from Christ and defending the interests of self. Just like Jesus never defended his own self and finally sacrificed himself on the cross to not save himself but for us. We should abandon our selfsensitivity and devote ourselves to God.
